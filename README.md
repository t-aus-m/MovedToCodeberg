# MovedToCodeberg
I moved all my private and public repos to Codeberg. You should probably do so too.

I did so because I don't want to support GitHub and Microsoft anymore. Codeberg is a small German association, which is in itself far more trustworthy than Microsoft will ever be.
Also it uses free Software ([Gitea](https://gitea.io)), which is the only reasonable thing to do, when hosting open source communities.

*If you got more reasons to switch to Codeberg, feel free to PR me.*
